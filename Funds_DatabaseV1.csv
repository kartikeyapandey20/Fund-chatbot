Series A Strategy
- $2-5M typical ticket (coinvest with Blume, Matrix, Sequoia)
- with ROFR to lead the B

Round is defined on the concept of risk not capital need
Fund economics work on the concept of 10x return to exit. With dilution this usually becomes 6x.
AVOID: product risk, bad founder, bad founder relationships
TAKE: once PMF done, Unit Economics not favorable, business model risk, competition, macro risk and execution risk.
focus: health, fintech, commerce/logistics, space, future of work, circular economy.

Better Tomorrow Ventures (BTV),,,Venture Capital,Seed,BFSI & Fintech,,$2-3M,$1M,$3M,Sheel Mohnot,IndiaGold,,SFO,,,"* BTV is Fintech only fund; first fund BTV-I was $75m (big hits - Unit; BTV II $125m + $75m opportunity; has hit $140m
  * His solo fund 500 FinTech before BTV-I which was $15m fund is 8x MOIC he said - biggies were Albert, Chipper, Bloom Credit)
* BTV I - Unit (Banking as a Service), Coast, Super.mx are blowout hits he said
  * $1-3m seed for 10-15%; seed sizes have supersized he said - not easy he said to get stakes.
* BTV II - raised $140m. All existing LPs reupped. He said they pushed for 2+20 => after 3X it is 25% with full catch up. He said they got lots of push back on this clause, but every fund 1 LP committed to fund 2 anyway, so he thinks they are getting through. Interesting how he is able to push this through…maybe with oru FundII performance, we can push for Fund V with similar.
* Tiger came in 4 of his companies - he said the same thing as I said - they come in at A and give money but no help, so BTV has to continue managing! Big issue. He complained to Scott. He said Scott is a good friend and had dinner at his $140m house.
* Everett Randle’s article on Tiger is the single best PR for Tiger Global per Scott. That one article repositioned Tiger as a legit operator in the minds of the Valley folks and not an undersized Softbank per Scott. People understood that Tiger is a serious operator and is playing per a strategy.

- Targeting 10 investments in India & SE Asia
- Valuations typically $300+ mn. Can do primary+secondary mix of max 60-40 ratio

- Largely sector agnostic, except crypto and gambling businesses (figuring out for lending businesses)
- Prefer being the sole lender. For >$100m deals, okay with bringing on more lenders.
- Preference for cross-border lending (vs on-ground) in USD currency to offshore entities.

- Typically $6-8 mn Series A, $12-15 mn Series B, thereon undetermined. Can also do small upto $1 mn, and as high as $30-40 mn. Long-term holding period, as single org. capital.
- Bhavani leads India practice. Earlier Bhavani and Sai ? team expanded to 5 people all based in BLR now.
- Sectors of interest: Somewhat agnostic, but like technology, venture business without tech are a hard-sell internally. Need a strong tech backbone. Sector-agnostic, but dislike lending businesses unless its' a software play (e.g. 42 Cards, Lentra).
